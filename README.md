# Plant-Species-Detection
üåø Project Title: Plant Species Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This project is a smart plant species detection system built using Python. It uses both traditional machine learning (Decision Tree) and deep learning (Convolutional Neural Networks - CNN) techniques to classify plant leaf images into four categories: Guava, Lemon, Mango, and Pomegranate.

üîç Key Features:

Image Upload & Preprocessing: Users can upload leaf images through a user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter.

Model Training:

Decision Tree Classifier: Trained using flattened image features.

CNN Model: Built using TensorFlow and trained on resized images for better accuracy.

Prediction & Visualization: The system shows predicted results directly on the image using OpenCV and matplotlib.

Model Saving/Loading: Efficiently stores and retrieves models using joblib and JSON.

‚ú® This project combines image processing, machine learning, deep learning, and GUI design, making it a complete end-to-end application for real-world use in plant species identification.
